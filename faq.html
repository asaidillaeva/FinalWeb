            <p>The Health Resource Library is available
                to patients and families dealing with the complex
                issues and emotional challenges that come with illness.
                The wide variety of available resources includes DVDs, books,
                and pamphlets. <br> A librarian can do health-related internet searches and
                have information sent to your room. The library is located in the Comprehensive
                Cancer Center and can be reached by emailing us.</p>

            <p> Our social workers are available to assess your needs. Services are confidential and may
                include short-term support counseling, problem-solving strategies, and information
                regarding resources. You can request a social worker's services

        <p class="topic">ROOM AND NURSE ASSIGNMENTS</p>
        <div class="txt">
            <p>You are assigned a room based on your diagnosis
                and which hospital beds are available. All
                rooms are private. A registered nurse (RN) will be assigned
                to your care. The RN may also have another nursing staff member,
                such as a certified nursing assistant (CNA), help with your care.
                Students from the Maurine Church Coburn School of Nursing at Monterey
                Peninsula College undergo clinical training at our hospital. Please
                let your nurse know if you do not want a nursing student to participate
                in your care. If you need anything, push the call button at your bedside
                to talk to a member of our nursing staff through a handheld speaker. <br>
                You may be transferred to another room or nursing department if your condition changes
                or if you need a higher level of nursing care. Transfer to another facility may
                be necessary if you need services we do not provide. Please discuss questions or
                concerns about your room or nurse assignment with the manager of the nursing unit.</p>

        <p class="topic">MUSIC AND BEDSIDE</p>
        <div class="txt">
            <p> Soothing Sounds, our therapeutic music program,
                is available six days a week, bringing live music
                to patient rooms. Any patient, family member, staff member,
                or doctor may request music. Ask your nurse or call ext.
                2892 from any hospital phone. <br>
                Our musicians are trained to use the inherent healing elements
                of live music and sound to enhance the healthcare environment.
                Research shows that certain music can relieve stress and anxiety,
                promote relaxation, and provide comfort. Patients who may benefit
                include those experiencing health challenges, injury,
                or transitions such as birth or the end of life. </p>
